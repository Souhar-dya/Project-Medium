# 🌟 Project: Hono + Cloudflare Workers + Prisma

Welcome to the documentation of this full-stack project built using **Hono**, **Cloudflare Workers**, and **Prisma**. This project is optimized for speed, scalability, and modern developer experience.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Hono**   | A fast, lightweight, and expressive web framework built for Cloudflare Workers. |
| **Cloudflare Workers** | Serverless execution of backend logic at the edge — low latency, instant scalability. |
| **Prisma ORM** | Type-safe and performant database access layer. |
| **`prisma-client-clearate`** | Lightweight Prisma client variant perfect for edge environments like Workers. |
| **Image Generation** | Used for user content, dynamic previews, OpenGraph cards, etc. |

---

## ⚙️ Why Prisma + prisma-client-clearate?

Prisma is known for:
- Type-safety
- Clean schema modeling
- Migrations and introspection

But in **Cloudflare Workers**, the traditional Prisma client can be too heavy.

✅ **`prisma-client-clearate`** solves that:
- Uses **`@prisma/client/edge`**
- Optimized for **cold start** and **performance at the edge**
- Reduces bundle size drastically
- Works perfectly with **SQLite or edge-compatible databases**

---

## ✨ Why Hono?

- Superfast (often faster than Express or Koa)
- Built for the **Edge runtime**
- Easy middleware pattern
- Native TypeScript support
- Compact and modern syntax

Example:
```ts
import { Hono } from 'hono';

const app = new Hono();
app.get('/', (c) => c.text('Hello, Edge!'));
