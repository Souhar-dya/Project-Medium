🌟 Project: Medium
Welcome to the documentation of this full-stack project built using Hono, Cloudflare Workers, and Prisma. This project is optimized for speed, scalability, and a modern developer experience.

🚀 Tech Stack
Technology	Purpose
Hono	A fast, lightweight, and expressive web framework built for Cloudflare Workers.
Cloudflare Workers	Serverless execution of backend logic at the edge — low latency, instant scalability.
Prisma ORM	Type-safe and performant database access layer.
prisma-client-clearate	Lightweight Prisma client variant perfect for edge environments like Workers.
⚙️ Why Prisma + prisma-client-clearate?
Prisma is known for:

Type-safety
Clean schema modeling
Migrations and introspection
But in Cloudflare Workers, the traditional Prisma client can be too heavy.

✅ prisma-client-clearate solves that:

Uses @prisma/client/edge
Optimized for cold start and performance at the edge
Reduces bundle size drastically
Works perfectly with SQLite or edge-compatible databases
✨ Why Hono?
Superfast (often faster than Express or Koa)
Built for the Edge runtime
Easy middleware pattern
Native TypeScript support
Compact and modern syntax
Example:

TypeScript
import { Hono } from 'hono';

const app = new Hono();
app.get('/', (c) => c.text('Hello, Edge!'));
